    <h1>What is Harmonify?</h1>
    Hi! Harmonify is a web browser-based music harmony engine with the following capabilities:
    <ul class=custom-list>
        <li>Find possible chords formed by a collection of notes</li>
        <li>Find the name of a scale given 7 notes</li>
        <li>Calculate pitch class set, normal order, prime form and interval vector of chords</li>
        <li>Generate harmonic circle in any supported scale for all chords and greek modes</li>
        <li>Calculate all available tensions for any chord in the circle</li>
        <li>Generate any heptatonic scale for any root note and mode</li>
        <li>Beautiful classical guitar sound for any chord</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How did it come to be?</h1>
    This story is prefaced by introducing myself. My name is José Julio Suárez, I was born in Ecuador and I'm <br>
    currently majoring in Computer Science.<br><br>
    Though I currently love doing code, my first love was music. I learned to play guitar since I was a kid, and <br>
    gradually started getting into theory as soon as I first listened to progressive rock and jazz fusion acts.<br>
    At first, my plan was to study a music major when I graduated from high school, but Ecuador's music scene is...<br>
    Quite dire. <br><br>
    As soon as I got out of high school, I applied for a full government scholarship at ESPOL, the biggest national<br>
    STEM school. However, at first I aimed to do an Electrical Engineering major, which didn't excite me that much<br>
    (if at all). But chance had it that every major at the school has an Intro to Programming class, which I absolutely<br>
    loved and did not waste a second more at EE before promptly switching to CS. I'm currently coursing 5th semester.<br>

    <h1>What to expect in the future?</h1>
    As far as my knowledge is concerned, I believe the page already implements all harmonic tools that I'd expect it to.<br>
    Going forward, I'm planning on starting other music-unrelated projects and this will probably only be updated to<br>
    fix bugs or logic faults. However, if you have a new feature suggestion or want something changed, feel free to<br>
    drop by my Github repo and post an issue with anything you want to tell me. You can also reach out to me on Instagram<br>
    at @euclasio.ini, or hear my original music at Spotify; Pedro Vicio and euclasio are my projects on there.
